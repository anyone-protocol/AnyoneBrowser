Complete anonymity at your fingertips

Anyone Browser is the free, open-source iOS browser that puts anonymity first. Powered by the decentralized Anyone Network, every connection routes through a global onion routing network, creating built-in anonymity more secure than any VPN, while remaining easy to use. 

Secure Onion Routing
Every user gets free access to routing over the Anyone Network. This isn’t a VPN add-on: this is trustless anonymity done right. Your traffic passes through a series of three encrypted hops run by node operators around the world. No single server knows both who you are and where you’re going; see your three-hop 'circuit' for every page you visit!

No Tracking, No Logging, Anywhere.
Traffic never touches centralized servers. Your ISP, Wi-Fi router, or even the websites you visit can’t track you.  The browser stores no history, and tabs can auto-delete all history every time you exit the app. You also get built-in protections against trackers:
- Script and cookie blocking
- Device fingerprint masking: hide your OS and default settings
- System obfuscation: masquerade as a different device altogether!

Fast, Private Browsing
Unlike older onion networks, the Anyone Network is built for speed. It’s noticeably less congested, meaning you can stream video, browse media-heavy sites, and get stuff done. 

Privacy, Your Way  
Take control with detailed privacy settings. Choose between Bronze, Silver, and Gold privacy levels, or customise every setting individually. Configure everything from:
- Your search engine 
- Local protection with Face ID, 
- Auto-delete tabs and more

Whether you care about data collection, surveillance, fingerprinting, or just want a browser that respects you, this is the complete privacy solution for iOS browsing.
